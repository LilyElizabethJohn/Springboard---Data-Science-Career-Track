    This is a Market Basket Analysis to predict if previously purchased items will be in the next order. 
    
    Pros 
    1)    This will be my first market basket analysis and as such I will get to learn a lot.
    2)    The concepts used might be more transferable to other projects/companies in the industry

    Cons
    1)    I don't know if it it too much to take on.
        

2) Zillow Zestimate

    To predict future sales price of homes.
    
    Pros 
    1)    I havent done a regression problem yet. So I definitely stand to benefit.

    Cons
    1)    I have already done a real estate classification project. My portfolio will end up having only real estate projects.
