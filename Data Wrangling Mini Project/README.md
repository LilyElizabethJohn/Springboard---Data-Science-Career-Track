JSON Excercise

Goal - Read in JSON dataset, Normalize dataset, Replace missing values and Create aggregate counts


JSON example, with fileÂ¶
demonstrates reading in a json file as a string and as a table
uses file containing data about projects funded by the World Bank 
data source: http://jsonstudio.com/resources/

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,
1) Find the 10 countries with most projects
2) Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3) In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

Approach
1) Read JSON into a DataFrame
2) Use groupby to get project count and get top 10 countries
3) Read JSON file as string
4) Normalize data
5) Get top 10 major project themes by using groupby on mjtheme_namecode
6) Map in missing theme names by getting a unique combination of code and name from the original dataset
7) Redo top 10 major project themes including the mapped in theme names
